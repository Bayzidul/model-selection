The selection process can be done by an autmoatic \r\nprocedure in the form of a sequence of tests such as F-tests or making use of the Akaike information criterion.\r\n\r\nAs [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box) noted,  \"The most that can be expected from any model is that it can \r\nsupply a useful approximation to reality: All models are wrong; some models are useful\".\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- [R](https://www.r-project.org/): environment for statistical computing and graphics\r\n- [car](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/): Companion to Applied Regression\r\n- [gplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html): Various R Programming Tools for Plotting Data\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n```bibtex\r\n@Manual{R,\r\ntitle = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\r\nauthor = {{R Core Team}},\r\norganization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\r\naddress = {Vienna, Austria},\r\nyear = {2013},\r\nnote = {{ISBN} 3-900051-07-0},\r\nurl = {http://www.R-project.org/},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bibtex\r\n@Book{car,\r\ntitle = {An {R} Companion to Applied Regression},\r\nedition = {Second},\r\nauthor = {John Fox and Sanford Weisberg},\r\nyear = {2011},\r\npublisher = {Sage},\r\naddress = {Thousand Oaks {CA}},\r\nurl = {http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/Companion},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
