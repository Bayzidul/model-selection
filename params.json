The selection process can be done by an autmoatic \r\nprocedure in the form of a sequence of tests such as F-tests or making use of the \r\nAkaike information criterion.\r\n\r\n\"The most that can be expected from any model is that it can  supply a useful approximation to reality: All models are wrong; some models are useful\". -- [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- [R](https://www.r-project.org/): environment for statistical computing and graphics\r\n- [car](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/): Companion to Applied Regression\r\n- [gplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html): Various R Programming Tools for Plotting Data\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- D.
