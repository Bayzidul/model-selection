# Model Selection with Stepwise Regression

While no model selection criteria is perfect, making use of the avaliable statistical
tools allows a researcher to systematically choose a set of predictive variables for a 
given set of data and critiria.  The selection process can be done by an autmoatic 
procedure in the form of a sequence of tests such as F-tests or making use of the 
Akaike information criterion.

"The most that can be expected from any model is that it can  supply a useful approximation to reality: All models are wrong; some models are useful". -- [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)
